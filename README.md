In this study, we answer two questions:
1. **Q1: What is the effect of U.S. tariff changes at the product‚Äìcountry level on U.S. imports of those goods?**  
   Basic economics tells us imports should decrease. Is that true empirically? If so, by how much?
2. **Q2: How is the U.S. average applied tariff rate associated with changes in the overall U.S. trade balance?**  
   Ideally, we'd see an increase, but the relationship can be confounded with exchange rate shocks or foreign retaliation. Which effect prevails?

## About The Project
In the United States, tariffs are a hot topic right now. An objective view is necessary. As of writing this, I have no idea the answers to these questions. I'm just curious‚Äîand perhaps eager to practice my skills in Python, data processing, econometrics, and Tableau.

## Methods
1. **Data Collection + Processing**
   - Source U.S. tariff, imports, and trade balance data from the [United States International Trade Commission (USITC) DataWeb](https://dataweb.usitc.gov/).
   - Create a tariff-import table for Q1, merged along products per foreign country per year.
   - Create an aggregated tariff-trade balance table for Q2, merged along years. Likely requires a custom import-weighted per-country tariff index.

3. **Econometric Analysis**
   - Run a high-dimensional entity and time fixed-effects panel regression of U.S. imports on ad valorem tariff rates to answer Q1.
   - Run a regression of U.S. trade balance on average tarrif rate, with macroeconomic controls, to answer Q2.

5. **Visualization w/ Tableau**  
   - Micro: Import responses by sector and country, dynamic event-study plots.  
   - Macro: Trends in U.S. average tariffs vs. trade balance.  
   - Interactive filters for country, sector, and time.

## Deliverables
- **Code:** Well-documented scripts and notebooks documenting data processing, analysis, and hypothesis tests.
- **Tableau Dashboard:** Interactive visualization of U.S. imports and trade balances per country, with sector-level analysis
- **Research Paper:** Formal presentation of results, interpretations, and policy suggestions.
